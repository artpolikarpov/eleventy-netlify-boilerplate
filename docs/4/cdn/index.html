<p>
  When serving many images from your site pages, their weight should be properly
  managed. Large images can skyrocket your page weight thus leading to the three
  essential problems: 
</p>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Degraded user experience.</li>
    <li>Lower search engine rankings.</li>
    <li>Decreased conversion rates.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  All three depend on the&nbsp;page-loading time. As large images increase the
  metric, you encounter higher bounce rates and a&nbsp;decrease in pageviews per
  visitor session. Google now treats your site’s performance as a&nbsp;signal to
  its core algorithm and may lower the position in search results for slower
  pages.
</p>

<p>
  You can improve your page-loading times and overcome the&nbsp; previously
  listed issues by&nbsp;serving your Fotorama images from a&nbsp;content delivery
  network specializing in&nbsp;images, Image CDN.<br>
  This approach well combines with cutting&nbsp;off any storage needs and
  getting your image gallery serverless.
</p>

<p>
  CDN is a&nbsp;large and geographically distributed network of&nbsp;nodes
  capable&nbsp;of caching your assets in&nbsp;many locations simultaneously.
  When users load your site&nbsp;or app, their browser requests page assets,
  and CDNs pick the best node&nbsp;to deliver content as fast as possible.
</p>

<p>
  Aside from global content delivery, image CDNs are capable&nbsp;of on-the-fly
  image transformation and optimization to further leverage your web performance.<br>
  This article is&nbsp;based on using <a href="https://uploadcare.com?utm_campaign=fotorama" target="_blank" class="js-analytics-click" data-action="uploadcare">Uploadcare</a>
  image CDN. It’s free and folks managed to perform large-scale research on how
  exactly image optimizations affect web performance and compiled an article on
  prioritizing and implementing. Here are the Medium references:

  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Every file uploaded (or&nbsp;ingested) to Uploadcare gets assigned a unique
  CDN URL that you can further use&nbsp;to request an image or modify it in near
  real time with simple URL directives.<br>
  Use those CDN URLs as&nbsp;sources for your Fotorama images to ensure serving
  optimized content to&nbsp;your site’s visitors: improving your behavioral metrics
  such as pageviews and bounce rates.<br>
  We crafted an&nbsp;essential example:
</p>

  <pre><code><span class='xml'><span class="tag">&lt;<span class="title">div</span> <span class="attribute">class</span>=<span class="value">"fotorama"</span>
     <span class="attribute">data-allowfullscreen</span>=<span class="value">"true"</span>></span>
  <span class="tag">&lt;<span class="title">img</span> <span class="attribute">src</span>=<span class="value">"https://ucarecdn.com/05f649bf-b70b-4cf8-90f7-2588ce404a08/"</span>></span>
  <span class="tag">&lt;<span class="title">img</span> <span class="attribute">src</span>=<span class="value">"https://ucarecdn.com/a9ed82c6-14f1-462e-849e-3b007c2aae87/"</span>></span>
<span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="title">div</span>></span></span></code></pre>

<p>
  The basic example covers using raw CDN&nbsp;URLs: serving unmodified images.
  Then, the next step&nbsp;is about applying the needed Image Transformations; you
  can find the complete list of possible options in the <a href="https://uploadcare.com/docs/image_transformations/?utm_campaign=fotorama" target="_blank" class="js-analytics-click" data-action="uploadcare">the Uploadcare Docs</a>.
  As already mentioned, you apply the transformations by appending them to the
  original CDN URLs. Some examples for the 3.6 MB original:
</p>

<p>
  Automatically serve images in the next-gen WebP format if a user&nbsp;browser
  supports it (1.6 MB):
</p>

<pre><code>https://ucarecdn.com/05f649bf-b70b-4cf8-90f7-2588ce404a08/-/format/auto/</code></pre>

<p>Apply compression presets to save image bandwidth (1.0 MB):</p>

<pre><code>https://ucarecdn.com/05f649bf-b70b-4cf8-90f7-2588ce404a08/-/quality/lightest/</code></pre>

<p>Resize images (94.8 KB):</p>

<pre><code>https://ucarecdn.com/05f649bf-b70b-4cf8-90f7-2588ce404a08/-/resize/680x/</code></pre>

<p>You can combine optimizations to maximize the effect (57.3 KB, 64x optimization):</p>

<pre><code>https://ucarecdn.com/05f649bf-b70b-4cf8-90f7-2588ce404a08/-/resize/680x/-/quality/lightest/-/format/auto/</code></pre>

<p>
  You can implement optimizations manually&nbsp;or configure your frontend&nbsp;to
  automatically add the&nbsp;needed postfixes to CDN URLs. You can understand the
  current state of your website’s performance with <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/" target="_blank">Google PageSpeed Insights</a>.
  Use the same to track your progress as you implement optimizations.
